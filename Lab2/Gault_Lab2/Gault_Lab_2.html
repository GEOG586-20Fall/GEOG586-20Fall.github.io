	<h1>Lab 2</h1>
	<h2>Where I spent my time growing up in Burnaby</h2>
	<h3>Prepared by Samantha Gault</h3>
	<p> I was born and raised in Burnaby, I moved to Calgary in 2017 to start my first year of univeristy at the University of Calgary. I have lived in Calgary for the vast majority of time these past three years but Burnaby will always hold a special place in my heart. Being able to do things like play outdoor soccer year round and not freeze in the snow is something that I will always miss.</p>
