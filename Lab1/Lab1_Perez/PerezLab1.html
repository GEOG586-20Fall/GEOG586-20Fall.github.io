        <h3> The Year of the Lost Purpose (Introduction)</h3>
        <p>After spending 13 years of my life in school, having worked hard for my grades and played harder (being a student athlete was tiring work), I found myself on a year off. Unsure about my future, I worked as a barista and saved money for whatever was to come. Whether that was school, travel, or something else entirely I did not know. What I did know was that I wanted to do something cool.  </p>
        <p> <strong>In comes Ucluelet (Ukee)</strong> - out of nowhere, a close friend throws the idea at me of road tripping out to the island (Vancouver Island, that is) in March. Beginning as a joke, it soon became very real. We took 2 weeks off, packed her old automobile up, and headed west.</p>
        </div>   
        
    <div id="phaseuno" class="right">
        <h3> Phase Uno - Slow & Slightly Upset</h3> 

          <p>The trip began with us shooting straight through Alberta and a chunk of BC, following the TransCanada/AB-1 W Hwy. My friend (lets call her Ji) drove through to Sicamous before exploding. </p>
          <p> <strong>"Why did she explode?"</strong> you ask. Well... her car was old, small, and <em>standard</em>. "My wrist hurts!" Ji exclaimed. I just laughed it off and encouraged her to pull over at a Tim's for a break. She glared at me.  </p>
          <p>"No," she said, "it's <em>your</em> turn to drive."</p>
          <p>I panicked, we argued, and I eventually ended up behind the wheel. I'd driven standard ONCE before. Getting the car started was a hastle, I stalled and cursed my way through it. <strong>First gear IS the devil himself.</strong> We moved slow, and I was stressed and slightly upset. We eventaully made it onto the highway where I never went below 5th and thanked the heavens for it.  </p>
        </div>

    <div id="phasedos" class="left" >
      <h3> Phase Dos - Van, Stanley, and Other Friends </h3>  
        <p>Driving into Vancouver as a new standard driver cost me my sanity, my blood pressure, and Ji's tires. Howe Street will forever have the burnt rubber of the tires I completely obliterated when accelerating while uphill from a complete stop. </p>
        <p>Here we stayed at an old friend's home. We drank, we ate, we made new friends, and I was introduced to the best cononut latte I had ever had. </p>
        <p>The second day there we explored Stanley Park - one of the coolest urban forests to ever exist. I will forever remember climbing its big trees. Grandville Island was another cool place to become acquainted with. The fish and chips were to die for. The last friend I met was the BC ferry at the Tsawwassen terminal bay. I'd riden on ferries before but nothing that big. This is how we got to the island.</p>
        </div>


      <div id="phasetres" class="right">
        <h3> Phase Tres - Surf till you die </h3>   
        <p>Once on the island we drove from Victoria to Ukee. I finally checked "Learn to surf" off my bucket list on Long Beach. Nothing cooler than learning how to surf right next to a giant rock dubbed "Incinerator Rock" (look up why it has that name, it's pretty cool). The rest of the time was spent surfing for 8 hours a day, sleeping, eating, then rinse and repeat. I surfed until my limbs were sore, my lungs were full of sand, and my face was frozen solid. Highlight of my life so far.</p>
