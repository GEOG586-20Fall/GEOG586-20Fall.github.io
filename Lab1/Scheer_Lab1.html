		<h1 style="size:16;">The Many Amenities of Dalhousie!</h1>
		<h2 style="size:13.5;">A map showing a selection of the surprising amount of walkable things that this community has to offer. </h2>
		<br>
		<p style="size:11;">For a Calgary community this far out of city centre, and this affordable, Dalhousie is loaded with essential amenities, options for places to shop and eat, multimodal transportation infrastructure, and parks. I've highlighted just a few on the map here, but this barely broaches the surface; each popup selection is near at least one decently-sized commercial cluster, and every one of them is within walking distance of pretty much the entire neighbourhood. Around the LRT station are a few townhouse complexes, as well as some 4 storey condo buildings and a few highrises sprinkled throughout. The rest of the neighbourhood is primarily lower density with single-family detached residential, and duplexes act as the bridge between the two for a seamless transition. For drivers, Crowchild, Shaganappi and John Laurie are all right nearby. A few of the parks you can see on the map happen to be off-leash dog parks as well. All in all, I love living here. While there are some awkward uses of space throughout, I think overall the city is doing a pretty great job turning this somewhat older, mostly suburban neighbourhood into a transit-oriented development.</p>
