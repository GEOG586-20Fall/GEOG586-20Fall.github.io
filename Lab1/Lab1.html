        <h3> The Year of the Lost Purpose (Introduction)</h3>
        <p>After spending 13 years of my life in school, having worked hard for my grades and played harder (being a student athlete was tiring work), I found myself on a year off. Unsure about my future, I worked as a barista and saved money for whatever was to come. Whether that was school, travel, or something else entirely I did not know. What I did know was that I wanted to do something cool.  </p>
        <p> <strong>In comes Ucluelet (Ukee)</strong> - out of nowhere, a close friend throws the idea at me of road tripping out to the island (Vancouver Island, that is). Beginning as a joke, it soon became very real. We took 2 weeks off, packed her old automobile up, and headed west.</p>

        <h3> Phase Uno - Slow & Slightly Upset</h3> 
    
          <p>The trip began with us shooting straight through Alberta and a chunk of BC, following the TransCanada/AB-1 W Hwy. My friend (lets call her Ji) drove through to Sicamous before exploding. </p>
          <p> <strong>"Why did she explode?"</strong> you ask. Well... her car was old, small, and <em>standard</em>. "My wrist hurts!" she exclaimed. I just laughed it off and encouraged her to pull over at a Tim's for a break. She glared at me.  </p>
          <p>"No," she said, "it's <em>your</em> turn to drive."</p>
          <p>I panicked, we argued, and I eventually ended up behind the wheel.</p>
          <p> I'd driven standard ONCE before. Getting the car started was a hastle, I stalled and cursed my way through it. First gear IS the devil himself. 
          <p> We moved slow, and I was stressed and slightly upset. We eventaully made it onto the highway where I never went below 5th and thanked the heavens for it.  </p>

    <div id="phasedos">
      <h3> Phase Dos - Van, Stanley, and Other Friends </h3>  
        <p>Driving into Vancouver as a new standard driver cost me my sanity, my blood pressure, and Ji's tires. Howe Street will forever have the burnt rubber of the tires I completely obliterated when accelerating while uphill from a complete stop. </p>
        <p>Here we stayed at an old friend's home. We drank, we ate, we made new friends, and I was introduced to the best cononut latte I will ever have. </p>
        
        <button onclick=coconut >Best Coconut Latte</button>
        
        <p>The second day there I explored Stanley Park - one of the coolest urban forests to ever exist. I will forever remember climbing its big trees</p>
        
        <button onclick=stanley >Stanley Boy</button>
        
        <p>Grandville Island was another cool place to become acquainted with. The fish and chips were to die for.</p>
        
         <button onclick=grandville>Grandville Island</button>
        
        <p>The last friend I met was the BC ferry at the Tsawwassen terminal bay. This is how we hopped into the island.</p>
        
        <button onclick=terminal>What's a Tsawwassen?</button>
        
      <div id="phasetres">
        <h3> Phase Tres - Surf till you die </h3>   
        <p>Once on The Island we drove from Victoria to Ukee. I finally checked "Learn to surf" off my bucket list on Long Beach. Nothing cooler than learning how to surf right next to a giant rock dubbed "Incinerator Rock". The rest of the time was spent surfing for 8 hours/day, sleeping, eating, then rinse and repeat. </p>
