	<h2>Boston Marathon: Information and History</h2>
	<p>The Boston Marathon is held annually in eastern Massachusetts on the third Monday of April. 
		In the state of Massachusetts this is Patriot's Day, but many Bostonians know it as 'Marathon Monday'.
		Most years, over thirty thousand qualifying runners from around the world come to run. More than half a million attend the race somewhere along the course.
		The 42.2 km (26.2 mile) race has been held annually since 1897. The only year the race has not been held is in 2020.</p>
		<p>The race has a rich history in the global running community and the city of Boston. There are thousands of stories about the race; only a few could be captured in the map below.
		The 'more resources' section below the map has links to more information about the race.</p>

Switzer' so that organizers would not know she was a woman, became the first woman to officially complete the race. Two miles into her run, she was assaulted by the race manager after he realized a woman was racing. After the incident, she was protected by other runners, her trainer, and her boyfriend, and completed the race.
