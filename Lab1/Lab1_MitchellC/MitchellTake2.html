	<h1>Hotspots for a student living in UofC Residence</h1>
	<h2>A Guide by Mitchell Cornish, Residence Community Ambassador & Geographer</h2>
	
	<p> Welcome to my webpage! My name is Mitchell and I am a 3rd year Geography major, and this is also my third year living in residence at the University of Calgary.
	This semester, I am enrolled in GEOG 586 with Dr. Burns!<br>For this project, I wanted to map out the different hotspots for a student such as myself living in residence.
	<br> There are various areas I like to explore and visit during my days on campus. Take a look at the map to see some of my favourite places!</p>
